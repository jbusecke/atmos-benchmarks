## README
This directory is for testing doing stuff with CDO. Current to-do list:
* Figure out how to interpolate slices; get weird artifacts when using 2-gridcell distance-weighted remapping of latitude slices that appear when trying to take meridional finite-difference derivatives.
* Figure out differences between vertical interpolation schemes, which one is best.
